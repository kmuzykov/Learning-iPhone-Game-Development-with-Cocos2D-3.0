### Learning-iPhone-Game-Development-with-Cocos2D-3.0

###### This repository contains all files that come with the **Learning iPhone Game Development with Cocos2D 3.0** book.

Normally you just download them from the <a href='https://www.packtpub.com/learning-iphone-game-development-with-cocos2d-3-0/book'>**Offical Page**</a> of the book. However, sometimes it is just easier to browse them on Github, this is why I decided to duplicate them here.

Each folder (e.g. **Chapter_04**) contains game art (images, spritesheets, audio files, ...) used in the correpsponding chapter as well as source code of the project (final code for the chapter, and sometimes indermidiate code).

If you want to learn more about the book please visit <a href='http://kirillmuzykov.com/my-cocos2d-book-published/'>**My Blog**</a> or read information on the <a href='https://www.packtpub.com/learning-iphone-game-development-with-cocos2d-3-0/book'>**Packt website**</a>.

There is also a <a href='http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWtuK3gIxoM'>**video**</a> on YouTube demonstrating some of the topics covered in the book.
